--- Spring Boot Reactive Project ---

This project is the client of this server: https://github.com/Florian935/springboot_server_multicast/tree/master

You can launch multiple instances of this client and connect to the server. The aim of this project is to demonstrate how to multicast a stream of value from the server thanks to the `share` operator and the router / handler style code.
